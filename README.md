# Expedition Appetite

Expedition Appetite is an application a user would use to get travel details/directions and find nearby food options like restaurants, near your destination. The user would first enter their *travel details* and tell us what *type of food* they were interested in. Then we would return back their travel details from a Google API and restaurant details of the Yelp API.

Now the user has their travel itinerary and options for places to eat!


## Objective of Project

This is our project of a group assignment which included the team members Jake Novelli, Serena Chandler, and Cheng Tang.



## Acceptance Criteria





## User Stories

Here are the User Stories we used to create our application.

## Wireframe vs Final Product

We started with a general idea of the page layout knowing that we would need:
1. A `<form>` for user input
2. A `<modal>` for user validation
3. Several `<button>` for previous search history
4. A `<div>` for the travel details
5. A `<div>` for the food details

## Technologies & Features Used

**High Overview of Technologies used**
[Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/)
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
[SweetAlert.js](https://sweetalert.js.org/)


**Materialize CSS**
We decided to use Materialize CSS for our framework due to the design language/styling, the simplicity of their documentation, and the ease of implementating their features.

Below are the features we used within our application:


**Media breakpoints**

Materialize CSS made has a get structure for their page layout and made it easy to implement **media breakpoints**

In our application, we employed 2 different breakpoints:
    - Medium - 33%
    - Small - 100%

Below is a sample of our code and how our application looks when resized:

```
<div class="row">
            <div id="searchArea" class="col s12 m4 l4 white-text">
                <h3>Search Area</h3>
                <form>
                    <div class="input-field">
                        <input class="originCity white-text" type="text" placeholder="Origin City">
                        <label for="origin-city"></label>
                    </div>
```

**Collapsible**

The **collapsible** feature was used in the Yelp API response to show details of the restaurants neare their destination. A nice option of this feature was adding the `class="active` on one the first element that way we could signal to the user that there is content inside of these elements and that they should click on them.

```
        <!-- COLLAPSIBLE CONTAINER FOR RESTAURANT SEARCH RESULTS -->
        <ul id="foodContainer" class="collapsible">
            <!-- JAVASCRIPT WILL RENDER UPON USER SEARCH -->
            <li class="active">
                <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons" style="color: #FC90A4;">push_pin</i>Name of Restaurant</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body row">
                    <div class="col s12 m4">
                        <img id="restImg1" class="responsive-img"
                            src="./assets/images/yelp image results/yelp-image-results-1.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <div id="restDetails1" class="col s12 m8">
                        <p class="flow-text">Address</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">$$$</p>
                        <p class="flow-text">Rating</p>
                        <a class="flow-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.yelp.com">Visit</a>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
```

## getting started
To get started, you can download the entire repository and start by opening the **index.html**
-before we even thought about coding, a large portion of the project started with planning.

-from the get go, we had planned on using a google maps API, although the original idea was to have it work with flu data, and give the user data on whether it was safe to travel.

-We ended up running into some trouble with the flu API, and after much brainstorming, ending up deciding instead on using a Yelp API, to give users feedback on local restaurnts in sreas they travel to.

## languages used
html- HTML wa sused as the basic building block for the website. 
JS- Javascript was used to create the interactible elements of the page
Jquery - importing the JQeury library allowed us to implify the sytntax, and more easily append elements to the page
Materialize - this was the main  framework that was used to build the layout of the page
CSS - CSS was used to apply specific elements to pieces of the page

## Prewview of the website

## code snippets (used to ensure user enters input data)
```
    if (requirements.origin === ''){ 
            swal({
                title: 'You did not enter an Origin!',
                text: 'Please try again',
                icon: 'error',
                button: 'Try Again'
            }) 
```

## code snippet ( How we used the APIS)
```
 $.ajax({
                url: googleAPI,
                method: 'GET'
            }).then(function(response){
                console.log(response);
                // Appending list items for previous searches
                searchHist.append('<a class="col waves-effect waves-light btn history" style="width: auto" data-prevSearch="search1">' + requirements.dCity + ', ' + requirements.dState + '</a>');
