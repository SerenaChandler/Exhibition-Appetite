# Expedition Appetite

Expedition Appetite is an application a user would use to get travel details/directions and find nearby food options like restaurants, near your destination. The user would first enter their *travel details* and tell us what *type of food* they were interested in. Then we would return back their travel details from a Google API and restaurant details of the Yelp API.

Now the user has their travel itinerary and options for places to eat!


## Objective of Project

This is our project of a group assignment which included the team members Jake Novelli, Serena Chandler, and Cheng Tang.

## Wireframe vs Final Product

We started with a general idea of the page layout knowing that we would need:
1. Form for user input
2. Modal for user validation
3. Buttons for previous search history
4. A <div> for the travel details
5. A <div> for the food details

**Materialize CSS**
We decided to use Materialize CSS for our framework due to the design language/styling, the simplicity of their documentation, and the ease of implementating their features.

## getting started
To get started, you can download the entire repository and start by opening the **index.html**
-before we even thought about coding, a large portion of the project started with planning.

-from the get go, we had planned on using a google maps API, although the original idea was to have it work with flu data, and give the user data on whether it was safe to travel.

-We ended up running into some trouble with the flu API, and after much brainstorming, ending up deciding instead on using a Yelp API, to give users feedback on local restaurnts in sreas they travel to.

## languages used
html- HTML wa sused as the basic building block for the website. 
JS- Javascript was used to create the interactible elements of the page
Jquery - importing the JQeury library allowed us to implify the sytntax, and more easily append elements to the page
Materialize - this was the main  framework that was used to build the layout of the page
CSS - CSS was used to apply specific elements to pieces of the page

## code snippets (used to ensure user enters input data)
```
    if (requirements.origin === ''){ 
            swal({
                title: 'You did not enter an Origin!',
                text: 'Please try again',
                icon: 'error',
                button: 'Try Again'
            }) 
```

## code snippet ( How we used the APIS)
```
 $.ajax({
                url: googleAPI,
                method: 'GET'
            }).then(function(response){
                console.log(response);
                // Appending list items for previous searches
                searchHist.append('<a class="col waves-effect waves-light btn history" style="width: auto" data-prevSearch="search1">' + requirements.dCity + ', ' + requirements.dState + '</a>');
