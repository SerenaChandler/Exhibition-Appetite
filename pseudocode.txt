HTML: use the materealize framework to construct a basic layout for the webpage.
- we will need a header
- We will use a container which holds a form which prompts the user to enter local, destination, and mode of transport
- the next container will be a site description, with basic instructions on how to navigate the site
- the next container will hold the results of the search, which include travel time
- the next container will hold flu chatter in the destination area (maybe even a graph if we get fancy)
- one final container will hold the footer


JS: We need to find and test APIs to ensure they function how we need them to
- create a function that will use the input data from the user to fetch the APIs    
    -this function will also store the input data in the local storage, so it can be saved and refered back to later.
-set up an onclick function for the submit button which will run the fetch function
- move through the DOM to decipher the needed information from the APIs
-With the results from the API, append it to specific IDs/Classes in the HTML
-within the input container, add modals which allow users to input data more easily
